# Machine Learning [Stanford/CS229]

## Remark
This repo contains all the Problem Sets of CS229, which includes Mathematical and Programming projects.
```
Problem_Sets
/PSi/src is implemented by me
/solutions are written by CS229 course professor
/PSi/Sol is written by others, which is not completely right.
```
